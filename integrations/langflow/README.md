# Stepflow Langflow Integration

A Python package for seamlessly integrating Langflow workflows with Stepflow, enabling conversion and execution of Langflow components within the Stepflow ecosystem.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üîÑ One-Command Conversion & Execution**: Convert Langflow JSON to Stepflow YAML and execute in a single command
- **üöÄ Real Langflow Execution**: Execute actual Langflow components with full type preservation
- **üß¨ 100% Component Compatibility**: Uses original Langflow component code and standard imports
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security First**: Safe JSON-only parsing without requiring full Langflow installation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
cd integrations/langflow
uv sync --dev

# Or with pip
pip install -e .
```

### Convert and Execute in One Command

```bash
# Execute with real Langflow components
uv run stepflow-langflow execute my-workflow.json '{"message": "Hello!"}'

# Dry-run to see converted workflow
uv run stepflow-langflow execute my-workflow.json --dry-run

# Keep files for debugging
uv run stepflow-langflow execute my-workflow.json '{"message": "Hello!"}' --keep-files --output-dir ./debug
```

### Individual Commands

```bash
# Analyze workflow structure
uv run stepflow-langflow analyze my-workflow.json

# Convert Langflow JSON to Stepflow YAML
uv run stepflow-langflow convert my-workflow.json output.yaml --pretty

# Validate a Langflow workflow
uv run stepflow-langflow validate my-workflow.json

# Start the component server
uv run stepflow-langflow serve
```

## üõ†Ô∏è CLI Reference

### `execute` Command

The primary command for converting and executing Langflow workflows:

```bash
uv run stepflow-langflow execute [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE [INPUT_JSON]
```

**Arguments:**
- `INPUT_FILE`: Path to Langflow JSON workflow file
- `INPUT_JSON`: JSON input data for the workflow (default: `{}`)

**Options:**
- `--config PATH`: Use custom stepflow configuration file
- `--stepflow-binary PATH`: Path to stepflow binary (auto-detected if not specified)
- `--timeout INTEGER`: Execution timeout in seconds (default: 60)
- `--dry-run`: Only convert, don't execute (shows converted YAML)
- `--keep-files`: Keep temporary files after execution
- `--output-dir PATH`: Directory to save temporary files

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic execution with real Langflow components
uv run stepflow-langflow execute examples/simple_chat.json '{"message": "Hi there!"}'

# Execution with custom timeout
uv run stepflow-langflow execute examples/basic_prompting.json '{"message": "Write a haiku"}' --timeout 120

# Debug with file preservation
uv run stepflow-langflow execute examples/memory_chatbot.json --dry-run --keep-files
```

### Other Commands

```bash
# Analyze workflow dependencies and structure
uv run stepflow-langflow analyze workflow.json

# Convert with validation and pretty printing
uv run stepflow-langflow convert workflow.json --validate --pretty

# Validate workflow structure
uv run stepflow-langflow validate workflow.json

# Start component server for Stepflow integration
uv run stepflow-langflow serve
```

## üîß Manual Stepflow Integration

For advanced use cases, you can integrate manually with Stepflow:

### 1. Configure Stepflow

Create `stepflow-config.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  builtin:
    type: builtin
  langflow:
    type: stepflow
    transport: stdio
    command: uv
    args: ["--project", "path/to/langflow/integration", "run", "stepflow-langflow-server"]

routes:
  "/langflow/{*component}":
    - plugin: langflow
  "/builtin/{*component}":
    - plugin: builtin

stateStore:
  type: inMemory
```

### 2. Convert and Run

```bash
# Convert workflow
uv run stepflow-langflow convert my-workflow.json my-workflow.yaml

# Run with Stepflow
cargo run -- run --flow my-workflow.yaml --input input.json --config stepflow-config.yml
```

## üêç Python API

```python
from stepflow_langflow_integration.converter.translator import LangflowConverter

# Basic conversion
converter = LangflowConverter()
stepflow_yaml = converter.convert_file("workflow.json")

# Analyze workflow structure
with open("workflow.json") as f:
    langflow_data = json.load(f)

analysis = converter.analyze(langflow_data)
print(f"Nodes: {analysis['node_count']}")
print(f"Component types: {analysis['component_types']}")

# Save converted workflow
with open("output.yaml", "w") as f:
    f.write(stepflow_yaml)
```

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

The integration follows a multi-stage approach for maximum compatibility and safety:

### 1. **JSON-First Parsing**
- Directly parses Langflow JSON export files
- No Langflow installation required for conversion
- Secure: no code execution during parsing phase

### 2. **Dependency Analysis & Topological Sorting**
- Maps Langflow edges to Stepflow step dependencies
- Uses Kahn's algorithm for proper execution ordering
- Handles complex dependency graphs with validation

### 3. **Schema Discovery**
- Extracts component input/output schemas from JSON metadata
- Maps Langflow types to Stepflow type system
- Preserves native type semantics

### 4. **UDF Component Execution**
- Stores original Langflow component code as blobs
- Executes via `UDFExecutor` for 100% compatibility
- Supports bidirectional communication with Stepflow runtime

### 5. **Type Preservation**
- Maintains Langflow `Message`, `Data`, `DataFrame` types
- Handles complex nested object serialization
- Automatic type conversion between systems

## üì¶ Supported Components

The integration supports all Langflow component types through UDF execution:

### üöÄ Quick Test Commands

All workflows accept a `"message"` field as their primary input. **Integration Status: Core workflows fully working with real execution.**

#### Real Execution Examples
```bash
# Working workflows with real Langflow component execution
# Requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

# 1. Simple Chat - Direct passthrough workflow ‚úÖ WORKING
uv run stepflow-langflow execute tests/fixtures/langflow/simple_chat.json \
  '{"message": "Hello from real execution!"}'

# 2. Basic Prompting - LLM with template processing ‚úÖ WORKING
uv run stepflow-langflow execute tests/fixtures/langflow/basic_prompting.json \
  '{"message": "Write a haiku about coding"}'

# 3. Memory Chatbot - Conversational AI with memory ‚úÖ WORKING
uv run stepflow-langflow execute tests/fixtures/langflow/memory_chatbot.json \
  '{"message": "Remember my name is Alice"}'

# 4. Document Q&A - Document-based question answering ‚úÖ WORKING
uv run stepflow-langflow execute tests/fixtures/langflow/document_qa.json \
  '{"message": "What is the main topic of this document?"}'

# 5. Simple Agent - AI agent with calculator/tools ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (OpenAI Agent execution issues)
# Note: Architecture works, but Agent execution may timeout. Use extended timeout:
uv run stepflow-langflow execute tests/fixtures/langflow/simple_agent.json \
  '{"message": "Calculate 15 * 23 and explain the result"}' --timeout 180

# 6. Vector Store RAG - Complex retrieval augmented generation ‚úÖ WORKING

# 7. OpenAI Chat - Direct OpenAI API integration ‚úÖ WORKING
uv run stepflow-langflow execute tests/fixtures/langflow/openai_chat.json \
  '{"message": "What is Python programming?"}'
```

### üí° Workflow Input Patterns & Status

All workflows expect JSON input with a `message` field:

| Workflow | Input Example | Description | Real Execution Status |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| `simple_chat.json` | `{"message": "Hello there!"}` | Basic greeting or question | ‚úÖ Working |
| `basic_prompting.json` | `{"message": "Write a poem about nature"}` | Creative prompts for LLM | ‚úÖ Working |
| `memory_chatbot.json` | `{"message": "Remember I like coffee"}` | Conversational input with memory | ‚úÖ Working |
| `document_qa.json` | `{"message": "Summarize this document"}` | Questions about documents | ‚úÖ Working |
| `simple_agent.json` | `{"message": "Calculate 42 * 17"}` | Tasks requiring tools/calculations | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (use --timeout 180) |
| `vector_store_rag.json` | `{"message": "Explain machine learning"}` | Knowledge retrieval queries | ‚úÖ Working |
| `openai_chat.json` | `{"message": "Explain quantum computing"}` | Direct chat with LLM | ‚úÖ Working |

### üîç Workflow Analysis

Understand workflow structure before execution:

```bash
# Analyze workflow complexity and dependencies
uv run stepflow-langflow analyze tests/fixtures/langflow/vector_store_rag.json

# View converted workflow without execution
uv run stepflow-langflow execute tests/fixtures/langflow/basic_prompting.json --dry-run

# Keep temporary files for debugging
uv run stepflow-langflow execute tests/fixtures/langflow/memory_chatbot.json \
  '{"message": "Test"}'  --keep-files --output-dir ./debug
```

### üéØ Production Execution Status

**Integration Status: Core workflows fully operational in production.**

#### ‚úÖ Fully Working Workflows (Real Execution)
The following workflows work reliably with real API execution:
- `simple_chat.json` - Direct passthrough workflow
- `basic_prompting.json` - LLM with template processing
- `memory_chatbot.json` - Conversational AI with memory
- `document_qa.json` - Document-based question answering
- `vector_store_rag.json` - Complex retrieval augmented generation
- `openai_chat.json` - Direct OpenAI API integration

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working Workflows
- `simple_agent.json` - Architecture complete but OpenAI Agent execution issues may cause timeouts
  - **Workaround**: Use extended timeout (`--timeout 180`) and validate with `` first

#### Environment Requirements
```bash
# Required environment variable for real execution
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"

# Optional: For vector store workflows requiring AstraDB
export ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT="your-astra-endpoint"
export ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN="your-astra-token"
```

#### Quick Production Test
```bash
# Test a working workflow with real API
uv run stepflow-langflow execute tests/fixtures/langflow/openai_chat.json \
  '{"message": "Hello, this is a production test!"}'

# Test with extended timeout for complex workflows
uv run stepflow-langflow execute tests/fixtures/langflow/vector_store_rag.json \
  '{"message": "Explain deep learning"}' --timeout 120
```
