Start an interactive REPL for workflow development and debugging.

Start an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for workflow development and debugging. The REPL provides an interactive environment for testing workflow fragments, debugging step execution, exploring component capabilities, and iterative workflow development.

# Examples

```bash

# Start REPL with default config

stepflow repl

# Start REPL with custom config

stepflow repl --config=development-config.yml

```

Usage: stepflow repl [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --config <FILE>
          The path to the stepflow config file.
          
          If not specified, will look for `stepflow-config.yml` in the directory containing the workflow file. If that isn't found, will also look in the current directory.

      --log-level <LEVEL>
          Set the log level for Stepflow
          
          [default: info]
          [possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error]

      --other-log-level <LEVEL>
          Set the log level for other parts of Stepflow
          
          [default: warn]
          [possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error]

      --log-file <FILE>
          Write logs to a file instead of stderr

      --omit-stack-trace
          Omit stack traces (line numbers of errors)

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
