# =============================================================================
# CI OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY
# =============================================================================
# This workflow uses path-based filtering to run checks only on changed sub-packages.
# This significantly reduces CI time by avoiding unnecessary work.
#
# APPROACH:
# 1. Use dorny/paths-filter to detect which sub-packages have changes
# 2. Use composite actions (.github/actions/*) to encapsulate package-specific logic
# 3. Run checks conditionally based on detected changes
# 4. Use a final aggregation job to ensure all required checks pass
#
# SUB-PACKAGES:
# - rust: stepflow-rs Rust workspace (crates/*)
# - python: sdks/python Python SDK
# - docs: docs/ Docusaurus documentation site
#
# EXTENDING THIS PATTERN:
# To add new sub-packages (e.g., TypeScript SDK, UI):
# 1. Create a new composite action in .github/actions/
# 2. Add path filters below in the 'changes' job
# 3. Add a conditional job that uses the new composite action
# 4. Update the 'check-success' job dependencies
# =============================================================================
